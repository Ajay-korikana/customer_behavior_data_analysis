Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data exploration to business insights and visualization. The objective is to analyze customer and transaction data, uncover meaningful patterns, and present insights through SQL analysis, dashboards, and business reporting.

The project focuses on applying practical analytics skills used in real-world data analyst roles, including Python-based data preparation, SQL querying, and Power BI visualization.

 Dataset

The dataset contains customer-level and transaction-level data

Includes demographic information, purchase details, behavioral metrics, and subscription-related fields

Data was analyzed for quality issues such as missing values and inconsistencies before use

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python – Data loading, EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering

SQL – Business analysis using PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visual storytelling

Gamma – Business presentation (PPT) creation

Excel / CSV – Data storage and intermediate outputs

 Project Workflow
1️ Data Loading & Exploration (Python)

Imported dataset using pandas

Reviewed structure, data types, and summary statistics

Identified missing values and data inconsistencies

2️ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing values using appropriate statistical methods

Standardized column names and formats

Created derived features to support deeper analysis

Validated data before database loading

3️ SQL-Based Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into a relational database

Executed SQL queries to answer business questions such as:

Revenue and sales trends

Customer segmentation

Subscription vs non-subscription behavior

Product and category performance

Used joins, aggregations, filtering, and conditional logic

4️ Power BI Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard to visualize:

Key KPIs

Revenue and sales distribution

Customer segments and demographics

Subscription and purchase behavior

Enabled filters for dynamic analysis

5️ Reporting & Presentation

Created a structured project report explaining methodology and insights

Designed a business presentation (PPT) using Gamma for clear stakeholder communication

 Dashboard Highlights
